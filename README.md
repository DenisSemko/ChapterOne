## General Information
In terms of the university diploma, there was developed a system that consists of back-end and front-end services.

System provides a friendly UI along with REST API requests to work with the theme about books, authors, online-library etc.

System's business logic provides a fast and comfortable algorithm to pick up the right book for the reader to buy.
The whole point is to find the book spontaneously, with the help of randomnly generated data about available readers, years of publishing, books themes and so on.
> To catch the whole idea about the algorithm and its structure, feel free to contact me [@dench327](https://linkedin.com/in/https://www.linkedin.com/in/denis-semko-551b91191).

System supports localization for two languages: 
 - Ukrainian
 - English

## Technologies Used
- ASP.NET Core 3.1
- Angular 12 & Angular Material

& many more!

## Setup
You need to download this repository and run it using Visual Studio 2019 or newer version or any other IDE that is suitable for you.
> You can run the back-end service via IIS Express!

> You can run the front-end service via installing all the dependencies with the command `npm install` and then using the command `npm start`!

**UPD:** 
> You need to run the front-end service with `ng serve --ssl --ssl-cert {path-to-your-cert} --ssl-key {path-to-your-key}` so your localhost will be HTTPS secured.

## Usage
After successful build via Visual Studio (or any other IDE compatible with .NET), you can access a back-end service as `https://localhost:yourport/swagger/index.html`
and a front-end service as `https://localhost:4200`.

## Project Status
Project is: _no longer being worked on_.
